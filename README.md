# Tireta

A magic drawer for your notes. Put it in there, find them from everywhere. Kind of a mix of Dropbox and Simple Note services.

It's a note repository. [Tireta](http://www.panoccitan.org/diccionari.aspx?diccion=s%u00f2fia&lenga=oc) is an occitan word for 'little drawer'

## Feature Roadmap

- There is an API to send notes to your account, get them, update and delete them.
- Users have account and an API key. Notes belong to an user.
- The user can choose whether to make a note public, private or share them with only chosen people.
- There is a syntax to tag note files. Tags are parsed upon submission of the note. Tags are searchable. The content of notes is also searchable.
- There is a client library and a tool to use the service from command line. The tool can sync a folder with the notes in the account.
